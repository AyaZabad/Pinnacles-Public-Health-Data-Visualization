## Gender
The illustrations shows the average percentage of male and female pateince across all Pinnacle barnches. Overall, there appears to be an even divide between patients of both female and male genders. However, this does not account for patients that do not identify with either, and could benefit from demographic representation.

## Deprivation

The visual shows the proportion of patients across different deprivation quantiles for all Pinnacle branches. There appears to be a big gap between the proprotion of enrolled patients in the lowest deprivation quantile and all the other quantiles. This indicates an inability to provide services to individuals on the low scale of the poverty index.
